### **1. Identify What’s Going Wrong**

Before fixing anything, you need to know what’s broken.

For two days, track your day like a time auditor. Write down what you do and when.

**Example:**

| Time     | Activity                      |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| 8:00 AM  | Scrolled Instagram in bed     |
| 9:00 AM  | Had breakfast + YouTube       |
| 10:00 AM | Opened laptop, got distracted |
| 1:00 PM  | Actually started real work    |

After tracking, look at where your time is leaking—spoiler: it’s probably your phone.

### **2. Make Distractions Hard to Reach**

Don’t just rely on willpower—use strategy.

- **Set app limits:** Most phones let you set daily usage timers. Stick to them.
- **Physically separate:** Leave your phone in a different room during focus time.
- **Block distractions:** Use browser extensions like “StayFocusd” or “LeechBlock” to block time-wasting sites.

These changes make distractions inconvenient, which is half the battle.

### **3. Win the Day with Daily Goals**

Each day, pick one **Super Task**—a task that must get done no matter what.

- If you finish your Super Task, the day’s a win.
- Bonus points if you finish a couple of **Mini Tasks** too.

**Example:**

- Super Task: Finish client report
- Mini Tasks: Clean room, reply to emails, 30-min workout

This keeps you focused and gives the day purpose.

### **4. Swap Bad Habits for Better Ones**

You can’t just “stop” procrastinating—you need to _replace_ it.

- Notice when you tend to fall off track (e.g., 2 PM slump).
- Start your work _before_ that window hits.
- Try the Pomodoro technique: 25 mins work, 5 mins break.

**Important:** Don’t touch your phone or TV during breaks. Try:

- Walking indoors
- Splashing water on your eyes
- Light stretching

Even if you procrastinate later, at least your priorities are done.

### **5. Build the Bigger Picture**

Daily goals are great, but long-term clarity fuels momentum.

- Set **short-term goals** (this week, this month)
- Set **long-term goals** (next 6 months, next year)

**Tools to help:**

- Use **Notion** or **Obsidian** to journal progress
- Use **Todoist**, **Microsoft To Do**, or **TickTick** for tracking tasks

Remember: some days will flop. That’s okay. Just don’t lose the thread.

### **Final Thoughts**

No one’s perfect. You’re not trying to be a productivity machine. You’re trying to reclaim your day, your attention, and your life—one small change at a time.
