title: "Rebuilding the Wheel: Engineering from First Principles"
description: They say reinventing the wheel is a waste of time — but building the wheel yourself teaches you more than any manual ever could. In this post, I walk through my journey of recreating foundational tools like Redis, Git, React, and more, and how it made me a better engineer.

## Introduction:

I started this journey of recreating technologies to learn more about them.
Quick list of recreated tools: Redis, Git, HTTP server, React clone, Vector DB, etc.
The common format I followed for each project is, I first noted down main features I wanted to recreate. My goal was not to create an exact replica. It was to learn the tech better. So I focused on building Proof of Concept using easier languages like python and javascript compared to c++ and rust.

## Recreating Redis in Node.js

#### What I Built

A simplified version of Redis — an in-memory key-value store — using Node.js. It supports basic commands like `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`, `EXPIRE`, etc, mimicking the Redis CLI experience.

#### How I Built It

- I used TCP sockets with the `net` module in Node.js to handle raw client connections.
- Parsed custom commands in RESP (Redis Serialization Protocol) format.
- Maintained an in-memory object as the core data store.
- Implemented basic expiration logic using `setTimeout`.

#### Features I Added

- String operations:  
  `PING`, `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`, `EXPIRE`, `TTL`, `INCR`, `DECR`, `LPUSH`, `RPUSH`, `LRANGE`, `LPOP`, `RPOP`
- TTL (time-to-live) expiration support
- Implemented persistence (in-memory, snapshot, append-only)
- A command parser that supports pipelining

#### What I Learned

- How TCP servers handle low-level communication
- Why Redis uses RESP instead of plain JSON
- How TTL works under the hood and the challenges with expiring keys
- Why Redis is single-threaded and how it avoids locks

### Reflections

**Why Rebuilding Matters**

- You gain intuition that no documentation or tutorial can offer.
- You start to appreciate trade-offs in real-world software (performance vs. simplicity, DX vs. complexity).
- It makes you fearless in diving into the source code of popular tools.
- Bonus: It’s fun. Seriously.

**Closing Thoughts**

- If you're ever stuck in tutorial hell or feel like you're not _really_ learning — try building the tool yourself.
- It won’t be perfect. That’s the point.
- In the end, it’s not about replacing Redis or Git — it’s about replacing your limits with curiosity.
